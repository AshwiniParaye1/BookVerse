# BookVerse

## Description

BookVerse API is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for managing a digital library. It provides functionalities for managing books, users, and borrowing records, including user authentication, role-based authorization, and CRUD operations for books.

## Features

- User registration and authentication using JWT
- Role-based access control (Admin and User roles)
- CRUD operations for books
- Borrowing and returning books
- User profile management
- Pagination for book listings
- Most frequently borrowed books endpoint

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=18)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB - Make sure you have a MongoDB instance running, either locally or remotely (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AshwiniParaye1/BookVerse.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd BookVerse
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

4.  Set up environment variables:

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add the following variables, adjusting values as necessary:

      ```
      PORT=3000
      MONGODB_URI=your-mongoDB-URI
      JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
      ```

      **Important:** Replace `your-secret-key` with a strong, random secret key for security. Ensure that `MONGODB_URI` points to your MongoDB instance. If you're using MongoDB Atlas, obtain the connection string from the Atlas dashboard.

## Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The server will start at http://localhost:3000 (or the port you specified in the .env file). You should see a "Listening on: [port]" message in the console.

## API Endpoints

(See detailed API Endpoints section below). Authentication is primarily handled using JWTs. Include the token in the Authorization header as Bearer <token>. Admin-only routes require both authentication and the user having the "admin" role.

## Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

To obtain a token, register a new user using the /api/users/register endpoint or log in with an existing user using the /api/users/login endpoint. The response will include a token field.

Include the token in the Authorization header of your requests as follows:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

## Authorization

Some endpoints are restricted to users with the "admin" role. These endpoints are protected by the auth middleware and the checkRole middleware. Attempting to access these endpoints without a valid token and the correct role will result in a 401 or 403 error.
